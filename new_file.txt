Did you know you can find word’s inside words???
For example......

There are many words hidden inside other words.
Let’s see which ones we can find…
If you look hard you’ll see

If you look in BOWL you can find OWL
And in SINK there is INK
Look in the BATHTUB and you’ll find BAT
In CUPBOARD it may really surprise

Sometimes letters of a hidden word
are not next to each other
And have to be moved around. For example:
In PACKAGE you can find CAGE
If you look in PRESENT you will find PEN
And TABLE has TALE
In these next words you will have to move the
Letters around a little more
If you want to find BEAR inside of BARREL and

Some words become other words by moving ALL the letters
around to form the new words.
